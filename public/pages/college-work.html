                    <p class="portfolio-description">The goal of this project was to create a personal online e-portfolio. The e-portfolio was required to have a welcome/about me page, gallery of work, tutorial page, sound studio page, navigation, images, copyright statement, descriptions. We had the option to either write the website ourselves, from scratch, or use a website builder. I wanted to challenge myself so I wrote mine from scratch. It took me some time to complete, I spent a lot of time trying to get the layout correct, but once I did, I enjoy adding in all the information. In my gallery of work page, I added some additional personal projects I was working on at the time. I also added a java simulation to reverse a string and a volume calculator with JavaScript.</p>

                    <p class="portfolio-description">The goal of this project was to create a 2d game using unity. The theme of the game was at the students discretion, however, the game was required to have a playable character and challenging game mechanics across multiple different levels. The game was also required to contain several physics based components such as colliders, triggers, joints and effectors.</p>
                    <p class="portfolio-description">I included several physics features such as a surface effectors and area effectors for moving the boulders and the conveyer belts. I also used physics materials to add a different levels bounce to surfaces and hinge joints for trap doors.</p>

                    <p class="portfolio-description">The goal of this project was to development a roguelike console game in c++. The games graphics had to be represented by a predefined set of ascii characters. The game had to follow the general idea of the player starting at the first level and making their way to the end, killing an enemies in their way, while picking up gold/power-ups. As well of that, I also incorporated some of my own features. I added a variety of different weapons, as well as a buy menu, which the player could use to buy stronger weapons. I included several different enemies/monsters were varied in difficulty. I also added game event logging, which outputs all the events that occur from the beginning of the game to the end in a txt file.</p>

                    <p class="portfolio-description">The goal of this project was to design a program with java using a design pattern of your choice. There was several requirements which included, a gui to display the objects and the ability to add, delete or edit them, serialization for storage, as well as RMI to demonstrate server-client communication. I chose to create was a simple application to list all of your favourite cars and used the MVC design pattern. The user is presented with a ui and is able to add cars and enter all their details such as make, model, year, body-type, number of doors and if its manual. The user can also remove cars and save the current session. Once the session has been saved, the data will persist to the next time the application is run.</p>

                    <p class="portfolio-description">The goal of this project was to use the OpenCV python package, along with trained algorithms, to detect specific objects in images and videos and write a report on your findings. The report had to include at least three parts, the tech stack, which explained all the software used, the images and videos used, and a report of the work completed. For my project, I used several detection methods such as face and eye detection, face and smile detection, number plate detection and car detection. I generated lots of different samples for each of the detection methods and used multiple classifiers in some cases to see if there was a different between them.</p>
