This was compulsory and had to be completed in order to progress to fourth year. I was lucky enough to be selected to do my placement in <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en" target="_blank" class="mono-space">Ericsson</a>. I was assigned to a team called ‘Looney Tunes’, which had ten members. My team was working on a project called <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/portfolio/cloud-software--services/network-management-and-automation/network-manager" target="_blank" class="mono-space">Ericsson Network Manager</a> (ENM). ENM is an operational support service that provides customers a centralized way of managing and maintaining different types of networks. My team was responsible for serveral low level components. I worked on several user stories, investigations, tasks & improvments throughout my time there. I feel that I learned so much over a short period of time and my whole outlook of software developnent changed, in the best way.</p>

I decided to use wordpress to make the website as it is very user friendly and it made it easier to pass control over to the vice principle when I was finished.

                    <p class="we-description">I started my college journey with this course in 2020 and it has taught me almost everything I love about programming since then. It has maintained a very good balance of practical coding work and problem solving as well as theory. As this course is focused specifically on vr and gaming, I have spent a lot of time working with unity, developing 2d, 3d and vr games. Although I have enjoyed my time creating and developing games, I personally would have preferred to learn about game engine development for example, as opposed to developing actual games. That being said, it has been a great course and I look forward to completing it next year.</p>

                    <p class="we-description">I first came into contact with c++ in my second year of college and I was instantly hooked. Its ability to provide low level control over resources and usage in high performance software was so interesting to me. It was a difficult learning process at first, which is why I started this course. I used it as an aid to refresh my mind on the work we completed in class and I also used it to progress onto more difficult topics quicker.</p>

                    <p class="we-description">I randomly stumbled upon rust while browsing the internet one day. It caught my eye as it was being compared to c++ for its high performance, and it also introduced a new concept called the borrow checker for memory safety. After researching rust online, I decided to start this course to learn the fundamentals of the language. It is a really interesting language with a nice work flow and syntax, which I plan to continue learning.</p>
